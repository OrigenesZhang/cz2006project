The functions inserts a pet (for the key combination not existing case) or modifies a pet (for key combination existing 
case). The function takes in three non-nullable variables, the name of the pet, the name of the pet's owner, and the 
breed of it, as well as four nullable variables, the gender, birthday, location and the weight of the pet.

The name and the breed of the pet are both string with at most 32 characters. If the string is too long, a ValueError 
would be raised.

If the name of the owner cannot be found among the registered users, a ObjectDoesNotExist exception is to be raised.

The gender an integer can either be 1 or 2, 1 for female and 2 for male. A zero in gender indicates the gender field is 
left empty but zero is not considered as a valid parameter in this field. For all invalid inputs in this field, a 
ValueError would be raised.

The birthday is a datetime.datetime.date object. If it is not in this type, a ValueError would be raised.

The location is a string of length not exceeding 128 characters. If not, a ValueError would be raised.

The weight is a positive float. If it is not a float, a TypeError would be raised. If it is not positive, a ValueError
would be raised.

If the breed is omitted in the parameter list, the original breed would be remained unchanged. However, for other 
attributes, an omission in parameter list means setting the corresponding attribute to None.
